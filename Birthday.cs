        Happy Birthday 🎂🥳 to myMama ❤️🎉 — full of wisdom 💡 (Proverbs 14:1)!
        myMama has given me so many reasons to live right and, most importantly, has taught me the essence of living upright 💪🏼💫.
        myMama is the best among the rest 👑💖. She is the most selfless person I’ve ever had in my life — always doing the most and giving her best for all 🌟💕. myMama is such a wonderful person; all I see her doing is putting things in place and holding the family together in one piece 🧩💗.
        As it is written, “She is clothed with strength and dignity, and she laughs without fear of the future” 💪🏼💫 (Proverbs 31:25).
        I pray that the Lord will bless you and keep you; may the Lord make His face shine on you and be gracious to you ✝️💫.
        In all this, all I ask from God for myMama this very day is God’s love, God’s strength, and long life ✝️💕.
        I pray God keeps myMama ❤️ around for a long time so she gets to harvest the fruit of the seeds she has planted and continually and patiently watered in her four wonderful gardens 🌼🌻🌺.
        Enjoy your day, myMama 🎂🎈
